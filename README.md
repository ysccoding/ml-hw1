## About Github 
------
Github is a SCM (Source Code Management) tool that will give us Version Control and many other features so that we can easily share code and work on different parts of the code at the same time!!

**git commit -m “[descriptive message of changes]”** - commit your staged content as a new commit snapshot

**git pull** - fetch and merge any commits from the tracking remote branch

**git push origin master** - Transmit local branch commits to the remote master branch
